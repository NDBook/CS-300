Analysis and Design

  The problem I aimed to solve in this project was to design a program for the advisors at ABC University that would read a .txt file which contained a catalog of course identifiers, course names, and the prerequisites to each course.  Then the course information would be stored in a data structure of my choosing
  and alphanumerically sorted within that structure.  After which the user would be given several menu options, most important of those options would be to search for a course by its course identification provided by the university, and print all relevant information pertaining to the respective course. 
  My approach to this problem was to have the program read the file line-by-line and simultaneously store the information in a vector.  I chose the vector sorting method because the run-time and memory allocation calculated out to be the quickest way to solve the problem.  I order to overcome any roadblocks,
  I did extensive research of sorting methods, their respective run-times, and reading over a .txt file.  This project has introduced me to an applicable method of data storage and analysis.  I see now, how I would apply my coding knowledge would be applied in a business environment and how I could simplify quartly
  tasks, through the use of reports, typically required of by employers.  This work has helped me realize that I will be able to reuse my code to read over any text file while only having to make minor adjustments to accomedate new requirements.
